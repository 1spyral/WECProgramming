If you have two servers with different wattages, and you have two tasks of different lengths that are both solvable, 
test if the program is knowledgeable enough to put the task with longer runtime in the server with lower wattage, to reduce power


also, the server has the option to just run both of the tasks consecutively on the server with lower wattage,
but should it do that? this would increase the # of turns taken to complete the task... which might be bad, depending on how 
the metrics are implemented (power metric vs turn metric)
